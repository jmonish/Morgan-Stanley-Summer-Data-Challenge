Machine Learning in Equity Research

Problem Statement:

Component 1 (Market Research):
• Leverage industry standard quantitative stock metrics (i.e. P/E, Price CAGR etc..) to determine and classify a company’s performance as over/under/neutral designation. 
• In addition, qualitatively research industry, company news, and market news to identify noteworthy information that may have contributed to the company’s stock performance over the 11 year study period

Component 2 (Detailed Data Analysis) – Use ML/NLP/AI or other modeling techniques to
• Analyze years of public data to include news, social media (i.e. Twitter), macroeconomic metrics, and/or firm published data
• Use time-series data from the above sources coupled with modeling techniques to tie their modeling learnings/results back to the qualitative learnings identified in
component 1
• Evaluate robustness of answers with model performance evaluation results, as well as how the modeling results tie back to component 1
